#Prompt the user to enter their first name and store it
first_name = input("Matthew")

#Prompt the user to enter their last name and store it
last_name = input("Conelius")

#Create a new variable for the user's full name 
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name

#Print the users full name
print("Full name:", full_name)

#the code asks for the first and last name 
#this output doesn't provide any space or sperator betwen the first and last name
#To fix this you can add spacewhile linking the first and last names
